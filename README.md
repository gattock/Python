This is a co-work with my course mate

This simulation use shallow water equations to simulate wave propagation in a square box.
In the file main.1 the boundary conditions impose reflexion of waves on the boundaries.

We will upload also a version with no reflection, and a version with reflection on not-flat boundaries 
(challenging ;) ), as in this nice video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0cZjOIfwos&t=5s : A wave traveling between two parabolic antennas
